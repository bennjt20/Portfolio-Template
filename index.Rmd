title: "John Bennett's Portfolio"
---

This website hosts my [portfolio](https://github.com/bennjt20/Portfolio-Template.git), which I developed as part of [Data Science for Psychologists](https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/). You'll find the links to ten portfolio pieces in the header. Each piece has a description of my goal for that portfolio, the type of product (animated graph, mediation graph, etc.), the data, and some interpretation. Please explore and borrow liberally! Where I have benefited from code created by someone else, I have credited their efforts with a link.
